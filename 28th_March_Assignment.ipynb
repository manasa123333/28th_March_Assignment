    "Ridge Regression shares many of the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but it also has some additional considerations due to the regularization term introduced. The assumptions of Ridge Regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is assumed to be linear. Ridge Regression, like OLS, is a linear regression technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Independence: The residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) should be independent. This assumption is crucial for the statistical inference and validity of hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. Homoscedasticity ensures that the spread of residuals is consistent, and it is essential for the reliability of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Normality of Residuals: While Ridge Regression is relatively robust to deviations from normality, it's still beneficial if the residuals are approximately normally distributed. Normality assumptions become less critical with larger sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. No Perfect Multicollinearity: Ridge Regression is designed to handle multicollinearity, but it assumes that there is no perfect multicollinearity, meaning that no independent variable is a perfect linear combination of others. Perfect multicollinearity can lead to numerical instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Stationarity (for time series data): If the data involves time series, the assumption of stationarity is important. Ridge Regression, like other regression techniques, assumes that the statistical properties of the data do not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. No Outliers: The presence of outliers can influence the results of regression analysis. While Ridge Regression is generally robust to outliers, it's still good practice to check for their presence and potential impact on the model."
